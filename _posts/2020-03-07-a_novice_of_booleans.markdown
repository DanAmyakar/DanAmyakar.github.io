I am probably not the best person to explain how to approch booleans (bool(s)), I dont have years of experiance in the software development industry. But I do have plenty of experiance troubleshooting live aircraft systems and some of the same logic applies. A quick google.com seach will define a boolean as a binary variable having two possible values, true and false. In its simplest version this is like a light switch, the light is either off and in a state we refer to as 'false', or the light is on and in a state we refer to as 'true'. There are other operators we can include to make this a very complex statement, but it all boils down to down does variable difffer or equal our comparator (does x = y? if so true, if not then false). A way more compecated verion is on every cuirut board in existanse with some kind of memory on it. Your computer and phone go through a series of boolean checks every time they start up or even when you hit the 'home' key. Upon hitting the power button, they both check to make sure there is power, if true, the various parts making up the computer and phone start working after you turn them on. If there isnt power, false, they act like paper weights.
