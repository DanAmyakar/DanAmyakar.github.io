I was recently reading up on should know information for interviews in regards to being a full stack dev. One of the things I though was interesting was the four parts of object oriented programming. The four parts are abstaction, encapsulation, inheritance, and ploymorphism.

Encapsulation is one of the fundamental concepts in object oriented programming and it describes the idea of bundling data and methods that work on that data within one unit called an object. This concept is often used to hide the internal representation or state of an object from the out side. By using modifers like public and prive on our methods and attributes within a class, we give, take, or restict the use of those methods and attributes within the same class, a sub-class, or other class within the same project.

Part of this mechanism is, if you have an attribute that is not visible from the outside of an object, and bundle it with methods that provide read/write (get/set) access to it then you can hide specific information and control access to the internal state of an object.
