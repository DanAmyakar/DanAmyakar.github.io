I don't write. The last time I had to consecuatively write something for someone not on a corperate level was in college more than a decade ago. I had a paper due in Engish every two weeks and really didn't put much effort into it. I understand that this is part of this program. This is an excersise in communication in a free hand form so we get more used to talking and getting our ideas out and on paper in a manner that flows and is comprehendale. Long sentance (refering to the previous line). Such a long line should usually be avoided. Most people don't read faster than they can talk. Not that this has any real bearing on the quality with which someone can write but definately plays a part in what someone would consider a long paper vs a short paper. Academia - class-room-land - tries to push people past that point where we read at the rate we speak. Most of us just end up talking faster to compensate with the teachers request. Not sure how to break that one. I am sure there was a thesis paper about it somewhere. A byproduct of this study would be it becoming public knowledge. Followed by the dozen or so companies that try to exploit it and attemp to make a product or service based on that study. Nice little tangent. Will write again soon.
